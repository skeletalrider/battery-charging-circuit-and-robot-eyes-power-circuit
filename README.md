# battery-charging-circuit-and-robot-eyes-power-circuit

i will use this file to describe the type of the battery to be used 
i see lithium ion is a good choice 
because it provides a good indurance 
and it would be 12v convinient 
and with an output current between 10-11 ampere 
and it should be connected with the robot arm circuit in series.

---------------------------------------------------------
now i will talk about the best connectivity or the
best orientation for the robot eyes "two leds"
i see it should be in parralel because it has many upsides 
in functionality if one led damaged by an excesive voltage
the other one won't be affected because they are in parallel
also the parallel orientation reduce power consumption and 
provides more efficient system and thatr's what we are 
looking for in our project we aim for effiency and quality.
